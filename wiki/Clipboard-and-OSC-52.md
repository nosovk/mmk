# Clipboard and OSC 52

mmk writes the system clipboard via the OSC 52 escape. Most modern terminal
emulators (alacritty, kitty, wezterm, foot, iterm2, recent gnome-terminal)
accept these writes by default. A few need explicit opt-in.

## Terminal-specific setup

- **tmux:** `set -g set-clipboard on` in your tmux config.
- **screen:** has no working OSC 52 path; consider switching to tmux.
- **kitty (older versions):** `clipboard_control write-clipboard` in
  `kitty.conf`.

## Diagnosing silent failures

If `Copied N chars` shows in the status bar but nothing lands in your
clipboard, your terminal is silently dropping the OSC 52 write. There is no
reliable round-trip to detect this from inside mmk — the protocol doesn't
acknowledge writes. Check your terminal's clipboard documentation for an
opt-in setting.
