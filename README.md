# mmk

> **A blazingly fast Slack TUI.**
> Keyboard-driven, beautifully themed, and under 20MB. One static binary. No Electron required.

`mmk` is derived from [gammons/slk](https://github.com/gammons/slk). It retains
Slack functionality during the Mattermost-only transition and is maintained as
an independent project.

`mmk` is a daily-driver replacement for the official Slack desktop client, built in Go with [bubbletea](https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea) and [lipgloss](https://github.com/charmbracelet/lipgloss).

## Why mmk?

- **Fast.** Cold start in milliseconds. Render-cached messages. SQLite-backed scrollback. Real-time over WebSocket.
- **Tiny.** ~19 MB on disk. ~60 MB RSS for a live multi-workspace session vs. 500 MB–1.5 GB for the official client. No node_modules, no Chromium, no 1Gb RAM tax.
- **Keyboard-first.** Vim-style modal editing. `j/k`, `h/l`, `i`, `Esc`.
- **Pretty.** 59 built-in themes, lipgloss-styled panels, true-pixel avatars on kitty (half-block fallback elsewhere), emoji shortcodes, day separators, and pill-style reactions.
- **Multi-workspace.** All your workspaces stay connected in parallel. `1`–`9` to instantly jump between them, with live unread badges in the rail.
- **Yours.** TOML config, custom themes, custom channel sections via glob, XDG-compliant paths.

## Highlights

- Real-time messages, edits, deletes, reactions, typing indicators
- Inline images (kitty graphics / sixel / half-block fallback) with full-screen preview
- Threads side panel + a workspace-wide threads view
- Smart paste: clipboard images, file paths, or text — multiple attachments + caption in one send
- Slack-native sidebar sections, kept live; or glob-based config sections
- Automatic auth from the Slack desktop app — no tokens to copy, no Slack App required
- Vim-style modal keybindings, fuzzy channel finder, workspace picker
- 59 themes + drop-in custom themes, live theme switcher
- OS desktop notifications on DMs, mentions, and configurable keywords

## Quick install

**Homebrew** (macOS and Linux):

```bash
brew install nosovk/tap/mmk
```

**Linux/macOS tarball** (auto-resolves the latest version):

```bash
VERSION=$(curl -fsSL https://api.github.com/repos/nosovk/mmk/releases/latest | grep -oE '"tag_name": *"v[^"]+"' | grep -oE 'v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+\.[0-9]+' | sed 's/^v//')
# Linux x86_64
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/nosovk/mmk/releases/latest/download/mmk_${VERSION}_linux_x86_64.tar.gz" | tar xz
# macOS Apple Silicon
curl -fsSL "https://github.com/nosovk/mmk/releases/latest/download/mmk_${VERSION}_darwin_arm64.tar.gz" | tar xz
sudo mv mmk /usr/local/bin/
```

**Go:**

```bash
go install -ldflags="-s -w" -trimpath github.com/nosovk/mmk/cmd/mmk@latest
```

For `.deb` / `.rpm` / `.apk` packages, Windows, build-from-source, and checksums, see the [Installation wiki page](https://github.com/nosovk/mmk/wiki/Installation).

## Setup

mmk reads your session directly from the **Slack desktop app** — no DevTools,
no tokens to copy. Make sure you're signed in to the desktop app, then:

```bash
mmk --add-workspace
```

mmk lists the workspaces you're signed in to; pick the ones you want and
you're done.

Full walkthrough: [Setup wiki page](https://github.com/nosovk/mmk/wiki/Setup).

## Enterprise Grid

mmk reuses the **desktop app's** existing signed-in session (the same session
your admin already sanctioned) rather than a browser session, which avoids the
session-anomaly alerts that browser-token extraction can trigger. If you're on
Enterprise Grid and still hit a sign-out or security alert after adding a
workspace, please file an issue — include your OS and Slack desktop version.

See [#5](https://github.com/nosovk/mmk/issues/5) for history.

## Inline images in tmux

If you run `mmk` inside tmux on a Kitty-capable terminal (Kitty, Ghostty,
WezTerm), images render natively as long as tmux passthrough is enabled:

```tmux
set -g allow-passthrough on
```

Reload tmux for the setting to take effect (`tmux kill-server`, then
reattach). Verify with:

```bash
tmux show -gv allow-passthrough
```

Expected output: `on` (or `all`).

If passthrough is off, `mmk` detects this at startup and falls back to
half-block rendering automatically — no config change needed. To force a
specific renderer regardless of detection, set `image_protocol` in
`config.toml` to `kitty`, `sixel`, `halfblock`, or `off`.

## Unread indicator in tmux

`mmk` sets the terminal window title to reflect unread state — for
example `mmk SW (3) +1` means three channels-with-unreads in the active
workspace and at least one other workspace also has unreads. The
two-letter prefix is the active workspace's initials (matching the
left-rail label).

Outside tmux this just works — modern terminals (Kitty, WezTerm,
Alacritty, Ghostty, iTerm2, Windows Terminal, gnome-terminal) render
title changes in their tab/window chrome.

Inside tmux there's an extra step. tmux intercepts the title escape
from mmk, and only re-emits it to the outer terminal when title
forwarding is on, *and* it uses its own title template by default
(`#W` = window name) rather than the pane's title. Add both lines to
`~/.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g set-titles on
set -g set-titles-string '#T'
```

`#T` (active pane title) is what carries mmk's string. Reload tmux for
the setting to take effect (`tmux kill-server`, then reattach). Verify
with:

```bash
tmux show -gv set-titles
tmux show -gv set-titles-string
```

Expected output: `on` and `#T`.

If you'd prefer mmk's unread indicator to work in tmux without any
config change at all, that's tracked as a follow-up — it requires
passing the title escape through tmux's DCS passthrough rather than
relying on `set-titles`. Not in this release.

## Debugging

Set `MMK_DEBUG=1` to enable a comprehensive debug log written to
`mmk-debug.log` in the current working directory. The file is
**truncated each run**, so reproduce the issue, quit mmk, then copy
the file before relaunching. Log lines are categorized
(`[cache]`, `[imgfetch]`, `[imgrender]`, `[ws]`, `[general]`) so
`grep '\[cache\]' mmk-debug.log` slices to one focus area.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. A few ground rules:

- **AI-assisted PRs are accepted** — and in fact encouraged — but only if
  they're driven by a **frontier model** (e.g. Claude Opus, GPT-5,
  Gemini Pro) running with **high thinking effort**. Low-effort,
  small-model output that nobody reviewed tends to create more work than
  it saves, and will be closed.
- Ideally, drive the work with the
  [superpowers](https://github.com/obra/superpowers) framework (or an
  equivalent skills/TDD-disciplined workflow). Brainstorm the design
  first, write tests, then implement.
- **For large feature additions, open an issue first.** Before sinking
  time into a big change, file an issue to discuss the idea and approach
  so we can agree on direction. Bug fixes and small improvements can go
  straight to a PR.
- Whether human- or AI-written, **you are responsible for your PR.**
  Understand the diff, make sure it builds and passes `go vet ./...` and
  `go test ./...`, and be ready to explain your choices in review.
