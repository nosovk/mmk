// ChannelSyncRow is a (channelID, synced_at) pair describing what the

// It used to drive the reconnect backfill's per-channel
// conversations.history fan-out; that caller is gone (see
// DB.MarkChannelsStale for what replaced it) and this is now a plain
// query with no fan-out semantics attached.
//
// SyncedAt is the unix-second timestamp recorded by
// SetChannelSyncedAt; 0 means the channel row is missing or the
// column was never set (treat as "no prior sync — fetch latest page
// only" upstream).

// channel_id in the messages table for the given workspace. Channels
// without any cached messages are excluded — they were either never
// visited in mmk or never received a WS message event, so there is
// nothing to "catch up on" via reconnect backfill.
//
// The LEFT JOIN against channels means messages whose channel row
// was never UpsertChannel'd still appear (with SyncedAt=0). This
// happens when WS pushes a message for a channel mmk hadn't
// discovered via conversations.list yet.
