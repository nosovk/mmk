// Counter tallies API requests by endpoint for one process.
//
// It exists because Phase 2b's success criteria are call counts — "a
// boot issues <= 10 API calls, with zero users.list and zero
// per-channel conversations.history fan-out" — and until this, the
// only way to check them was scrolling debug logs. Nobody is testing
// mmk against a real Enterprise Grid account until all three grid-parity
// phases land, so a local count is the only feedback loop there is.
//
// The zero value is ready to use. Safe for concurrent use: RoundTrip
// runs on many goroutines at once.

// DefaultCounter is the process-wide tally. NewBrowserHTTPClient and
// NewImageHTTPClient attach it to the transports they build, and it is
// the handle cmd/mmk reads at shutdown to print the count.
//
// A package-level counter rather than a per-client one because the
// number the success criteria are stated in is per-BOOT, not
// per-client: one boot drives several separate http.Clients (the API
// client in internal/slack, the image client, the fetcher in
// internal/image), and summing N tallies at shutdown would mean
// plumbing N handles through to main for a diagnostic. Callers who
// want an isolated tally already have one — set
// BrowserTransport.Counter explicitly, which overrides this — so no
// per-client option is offered on top of that.
//
// Coverage is NOT yet complete: internal/slack builds its
// BrowserTransport as a literal rather than through a constructor
// here, so the workspace API client — the bulk of the traffic — does
// not tally until that literal gets `Counter: slackhttp.DefaultCounter`.
// That is a change to another package and belongs with the task that
// reads the number.
//
// It is a var so tests can substitute a fresh Counter; nothing in
// production reassigns it.
