// WithReason returns a context carrying the _x_reason value for the
// request(s) made with it. Slack's web client tags every API call with
// the UI action that triggered it, e.g. "message-pane/requestHistory",
// "unread-counts/onLastReadUpdated", "initial-data", "boot". Requests
// with no reason at all are one more way mmk's traffic differs from
// the official client's.
//
// _x_reason rides the context rather than a transport field because it
// is caller intent: only the call site knows which UI action it is
// serving, and that knowledge would otherwise have to be threaded
// through every API signature.
//
// Note for the code that consumes this: _x_reason is a *body* field,
// not a query param — unlike _x_id, _x_csid, and slack_route, which are
// query params. Across the 2026-07-30 captures it appears 153 times as
// a form field and zero times in a query string, with 48 distinct
// values; the four examples above occur 11, 3, 2 and 6 times
// respectively. See
// docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-30-enterprise-grid-bootstrap-design.md.

// defaultReasons maps an API method name to the _x_reason the official
// web client sends for it, for the endpoints mmk actually calls. Each
// value was read off the 2026-07-30 captures — these are observed, not
// invented.
//
// This table exists because WithReason is caller intent and almost no
// caller supplies it: for a long time exactly one production call site
// did. Every other request therefore emitted the trailing envelope
// _x_mode/_x_sonic/_x_app_name with no _x_reason at all. The real
// client sends _x_reason on 153 of 163 requests, so "body has _x_mode
// and lacks _x_reason" was a single predicate matching ~6% of official
// traffic and ~100% of mmk's — a sharper separator than sending no
// _x_* fields at all, which is what mmk did before this package
// existed.
//
// conversations.history also appears in the captures as
// "unread-counts/onLastReadUpdated" when the client refreshes around
// the unread marker. That variant is caller-specific, so it stays a
// WithReason override rather than a second table entry: an explicit
// reason always beats the default.

// genericReason is what an endpoint with no entry in defaultReasons
// gets.
//
// HONEST CAVEAT: this pairing is a GUESS. The string itself is real —
// the captures show the official client sending
// "conditional-fetch-manager" on users.channelSections.list, so it is
// not an mmk-invented value that would stand out on its own — but
// there is no capture evidence that the real client ever sends it on,
// say, chat.postMessage. Treat it as unverified.
//
// It is still the right call, because the alternative is emitting
// nothing, and nothing is the separator this whole table exists to
// remove. A wrong-but-attested reason puts mmk inside the 94% of
// requests that carry the field; an absent one puts it in a 6% bucket
// on every single request. If a future capture covers more endpoints,
// move them into defaultReasons and shrink this fallback's reach.
//
// ATTESTED is the load-bearing word, and it is now pinned rather than
// asserted: TestGenericReasonIsAValueTheOfficialClientSends requires
// this string to be one of the 48 _x_reason values recorded in
// testdata/official-request-shape.json. It has to be, because this
// constant covers every endpoint missing from the table above and so
// rides more of mmk's traffic than any single entry in it. Before that
// test only its PRESENCE was pinned: setting it to "" failed, and
// setting it to "mmk-tui-fetch" — a string in zero captures, on nearly
// every request mmk makes — passed the whole suite.

// xReasonExcludedMethods is the set of API methods whose form bodies
// the official web client sends WITHOUT _x_reason at all. Sibling of
// mode.go's xModeExcludedMethods, and deliberately a second small
// table rather than a merged one: mode.go's entry carries a long
// evidence-and-caveat comment that a restructure would have to rewrite
// wholesale, for no gain the subset test below does not already give.
//
// Measured across the 2026-07-30 captures: of 163 form-body API
// requests, 153 carry _x_reason and 10 do not. The split is clean
// per-endpoint — zero endpoints are mixed — and these five account for
// all 10, at n=2 each.
//
// The two tables nest. The full joint distribution of the flags is:
//
//	(_x_reason, _x_mode) -> count
//	  (true,  true)  -> 149
//	  (true,  false) ->   4
//	  (false, false) ->  10
//	  (false, true)  ->   0   <-- never observed
//
// So there are three tiers, not four: these five send neither flag;
// client.shouldReload and client.userBoot send _x_reason but no
// _x_mode; everything else sends both. This set is therefore a strict
// SUBSET of xModeExcludedMethods, pinned by
// TestXReasonExclusionIsSubsetOfXModeExclusion.
//
// The empty cell matters on its own. "Carries _x_mode, carries no
// _x_reason" is the exact single-predicate separator the defaultReasons
// table above was introduced to close, and it must stay closed no
// matter what a future edit does to either table — see sendsXMode,
// which enforces it structurally rather than trusting the two sets to
// keep agreeing.
//
// SAME CAVEAT AS mode.go, and it applies with equal force here: all
// five are boot-phase calls and every observation of all five is at
// boot time, so the captures cannot separate "these endpoints never
// carry _x_reason" from "nothing carries one until some boot event
// fires". This table encodes the former because it is what was
// measured, and because it emits the right bytes for every endpoint
// there is evidence for either way.
//
// Lookup is by exact method name, as in mode.go, and a prefix match
// would be wrong in the same concrete ways: "conversations.view" would
// swallow conversations.viewers, "client.getWebSocketURL" would
// swallow a hypothetical client.getWebSocketURLv2, and
// "features.access.policies.list" would swallow
// features.access.policies.listMore.

// these five endpoints, and the client puts no _x_reason there for any
// caller intent. Honouring a WithReason here would reintroduce exactly
// the divergence the set removes, silently, from whichever call site
