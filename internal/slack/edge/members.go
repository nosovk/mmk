// usersListFilter is the audience selector every captured users/list
// request carries, byte for byte in 4 of 4 observations.
//
// It reads like a query language and is not one this package invents
// or composes: it is a literal copied off the wire. Building it from
// parts — or exposing it as a parameter so a caller could ask for
// "everyone" — would put a string on the wire that the official
// client has never been seen sending, which is the whole class of
// divergence this package exists to remove. If a future capture shows
// a second value, add a second constant with the capture that backs
// it rather than making this configurable.
const usersListFilter = "everyone AND NOT bots AND NOT apps"

// UsersList returns the members of one channel, server-ranked.
//
// This is the channel-scoped replacement for a users.list walk. The
// distinction is the entire point: mmk's ~50-page users.list sweep is
// what gets a Grid account signed out for "data scraping", and in 8
// captures of the official web client there is no workspace-wide
// member fetch at all — every member lookup it makes is scoped to a
// channel, which is what this is.
//
// count is the caller's page size. It is a parameter rather than a
// constant because the captures disagree: three requests asked for 30
// and one asked for 20, so there is no single value to pin. Keep it
// near that range. Nothing here enforces an upper bound — the
// captures record no server limit, and inventing one would be a
// guess — but a caller asking for thousands has rebuilt the
// enumeration in one request instead of fifty, and the fingerprint
// does not care which shape it arrived in.
//
// The asymmetry with the `count <= 0` check below is deliberate, not
// an oversight. A non-positive count has a knowably wrong shape —
// `count:0` is a request no capture shows and the server can only
// reject or answer uselessly — whereas the upper hazard is a
// judgement about volume with no observed threshold behind it.
// Erroring on the first is enforcing the captures; erroring on the
// second would be enforcing a number this package made up.
//
// # truncated, and the cursor that is deliberately not returned
//
// The response carried a next_marker pagination cursor in 3 of 4
// observations. All three that had one asked for 30 and got 30 back;
// the one without asked for 20 and got 4. "Present exactly when the
// page came back full" is the obvious reading of that, but note the
// denominator before relying on it: only one observation
// discriminates, because only one short page was ever seen. If the
// server ever returns a marker on a non-full page — or omits one on a
// full page — `truncated` is silently wrong, and unlike a cursor it
// gives the caller nothing to inspect and no way to notice. Treat the
// correlation as inferred from a single sample rather than promised.
//
// This returns whether that marker was present and not the marker
// itself.
//
// That is a deliberate narrowing, for two reasons.
//
// The first is evidential: no captured request carries a cursor key
// at all. The request key set is token/channels/present_first/filter/
// count in 4 of 4 — the official client received next_marker three
// times and never sent one back. So this package does not know what
// the parameter is called, and handing callers an opaque string they
// could only use by guessing a request key would be inventing a
// contract, which is the failure mode this phase exists to correct.
//
// The second is the point of the phase: following that cursor in a
// loop is enumeration. A caller looping until next_marker is empty
// reproduces the exact users.list fingerprint — a burst of sequential
// full-page fetches against one credential — with a different
// endpoint on the front of it, and the sign-out that motivated this
// work would follow just the same. Phase 2b must not do that. Not
// returning the cursor makes it something a future author has to add
// on purpose, with a capture to justify it, rather than something
// that is already sitting there in the return values.
//
// What the boolean buys is the thing a UI actually needs: whether the
// list it is about to render is the whole channel. A caller can say
// "30+ members" honestly, and reach for UsersCounts when it wants the
// real total, which is a single request rather than a walk.
//
// channelID and count are validated rather than defaulted. An empty
// channel id would put `channels:[""]` on the wire, and a
// non-positive count `count:0` — shapes no capture shows and the
// server can only reject or answer uselessly. Note this differs from
// ChannelsSearch, which returns empty for an empty query without
// erroring: an empty search box is a state a user is in constantly,
// whereas there is no moment in a channel-scoped lookup where the
// caller legitimately has no channel.

// ChannelsMembership asks which of userIDs belong to one channel.
//
// The server partitions the ids it was given: every id sent came back
// in exactly one of members or non_members in all 10 observations.
// That is what makes this the channel-scoped answer to "is this
// person in here" — the caller names the people it cares about
// instead of pulling the channel's roster.
//
// Both arrays are optional on the wire and each is absent when it
// would be empty: members is missing when nobody in the batch belongs
// (1 of 10), non_members when everybody does (5 of 10). Absence means
// empty and is never an error.
//
// This is emphatically not batched. The largest observed request
// carried 66 ids in one go, so splitting it the way channels/info and
// users/info are split would emit a run of requests where the
// official client emits one.
//
// An empty userIDs makes no request: `users:[]` is a shape no capture
// shows (the smallest observed is 1) and could only come back empty
// anyway. Unlike UsersList's empty channel this is not a caller bug —
// filtering a set of ids down to none is the ordinary way to arrive
// here — so it returns empty rather than erroring.
//
// The response also echoes the channel id back. It is deliberately
// not modelled: the value is one the caller supplied a moment
// earlier, so it carries no information, and asserting on it would
// add a failure mode no observation exercises.
//
// The partition invariant is likewise observed rather than enforced.
// Nothing here checks that the two arrays cover userIDs, because a
// capture that violated it would then fail a call that the official
// client would have accepted. A caller that needs certainty about a
// specific id should check for it explicitly rather than inferring
// non-membership from absence.
