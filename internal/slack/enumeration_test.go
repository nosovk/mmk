// TestSlackAPI_DeclaresNoWorkspaceEnumeration pins the deletions that
// stop mmk's call pattern looking like a scraper.
//
// SlackAPI is the only route from mmk into slack-go — Client.api is
// that interface and nothing else constructs a slack.Client outside
// this package — so a method absent from it cannot be called at all.
// That makes this a stronger guard than counting calls in a fake: it
// fails at the point someone re-adds the capability, not at the point
// they use it.
//
// Each entry names the endpoint and why it is gone, because the
// deletions look like lost functionality to anyone who did not measure
// them. The replacements are on the map values.
